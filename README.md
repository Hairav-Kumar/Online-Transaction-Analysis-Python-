# Online-Transaction-Analysis-Python-
Project Summary: Online Transaction Analysis

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing online transaction data, similar to platforms like PhonePe, to derive key insights and patterns using Python and the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. The dataset includes information about transactions, including the transaction amount, status, type, payment method, city, and more. The goal is to explore various dimensions of the data, such as transaction status trends, payment method preferences, regional insights, and patterns over time.

Key Objectives:
To analyze transaction data and derive actionable insights.
To identify trends and patterns across different dimensions, including payment methods, transaction types, cities, and transaction statuses.
To visualize key metrics and relationships for better understanding and decision-making.

Problem Statement:
Analyze online transactions to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies that provide actionable insights for a digital payment platform (like PhonePe). This analysis aims to understand user behavior, transaction trends, and business growth opportunities.

Key Questions:
What is the total transaction amount for each transaction type?
Which city has the highest number of successful transactions?
What is the average transaction amount for each payment method?
What is the trend of total transactions over time?
Which transaction type has the highest failure rate?
What is the percentage distribution of payment methods?
What is the correlation between transaction amount and transaction status?
Identify the top 5 cities by total transaction amount.
What is the monthly distribution of transactions by type?
What is the count of failed transactions over time, and what patterns emerge?

Tools and Technologies Used:
Pandas: Data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization (bar plots, pie charts, line plots, etc.).
Python: For scripting and data analysis.
